## Introduction to Flexbox

### Flex conteiner and Flex items

A flex container is any element that has `display: flex` on it. A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container.

Any element can be both a flex container _and_ a flex item, put `display: flex` on a flex item, and then use flexbox to arrange its children.
